        <p>In this study, we are interested in how people make judgements given limited information. </p>
        <p>You will complete <strong>${N_Trials} rounds</strong>. In each round, we will randomly draw a <strong>bundle of 10 sticks</strong>, each with a height between <strong>1 and 100</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>However, you <strong>won't see all the sticks</strong>—some will be <strong>covered</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The visible sticks might be the <strong>tallest</strong>, the <strong>shortest</strong>, or <strong> randomly </strong> selected.</li>
            <li>The number of covered sticks will <strong>vary by round</strong> and whether they are the tallest, shortest or randomly selected will vary by round.</li>

        <h3>Your Task</h3>
        <p>Your job in each round will be to estimate the <strong>average height</strong> of all <strong>10 sticks</strong>, including the covered ones.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Payment</h3>
        <p>The closer your guess is to the correct average, the <strong>higher your final bonus</strong> will be.</p>
        <p>Your <strong>bonus</strong> will be determined as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One round will be selected at random to determine your bonus.</li>
            <li>You start with a <strong>${2}$ bonus</strong>.</li>
